## Feature
- Split internal logic "rhpkg" to publish the tool on github.
- Create Copr repo from script by a recipe file's requires, install information.

## Bug

- retry feature does not work.
  => Maybe fixed. But will add log message for that. Retry 1, 2, 3..
- Stop program immediately after getting SIGINT (Ctrl+C) from user.
  without retrying.

## Refactoring

- Add Copr build to integration.
- Add documentation with Sphinx.
- Rewrite the integration test with Python.
  Current bash test script is so complecated to maintain by bash.
- Do more Pythonic (Python Style).
  It's good to refer flask source structure.
  - downloader directory => downloaders.py
  - builders directory => builders.py
- Run the integration test from tox.
- Add shell code style task to Makefile for "sh -n", "bashate", "shellcheck".
  make test-style
    => make flask8
    => make test-style-bash
      for bash_file in bash_files:
         check with "sh -n"
         check with "bashate"
         check with "shellcheck"
- Check other TODOs
  $ grep -r TODO .
