## Feature

- Improve logging, --debug (-d) option.
  Ref: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/logging/
- Custom download
- Split internal logic "rhpkg" to publish the tool on github.
- Create Copr repo from script by a recipe file's requires, install information.

## Bug

- retry feature does not work.

## Refactoring

- Change project/repository name
  from "scl-rebuild-helper2" to new one without using "scl",
  such as "rpm-rebuild_helper"
  A range of the tool responsibility is not only building SCL, but also
  "building continual packages by recipe file"
  Replace "scl" keyword to another word.
- Improve exception info during the build.
  Add package, num_name, application directory to the exception.
- Add Copr build to integration.
- Add documentation with Sphinx.
- Rewrite the integration test with Python.
  Current bash test script is so complecated to maintain by bash.
- Do more Pythonic (Python Style).
  It's good to refer flask source structure.
  - downloader directory => downloaders.py
  - builders directory => builders.py
- Run the integration test from tox.
- Check other TODOs
  $ grep -r TODO .
